        <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">W</span>hen I was a little girl, I lived in a small village where was surround by the rice field. During Spring, there were always green when I open my window. My famiy and other village people were busy working on the rice field. Every moring, I waved to them from my window; when they look at me, I made silly faces and they laughed really hard.Green is the color of nature. It symbolizes growth, harmony, freshness, and fertility. Green has strong emotional correspondence with safety.</p>

        <p><strong><span>A</span></strong>s I grow up more, my family moved to the United State. I started school here and I attend college far away from my family. Living by myself was not easy, I have to find a place to rent, buy my own food and cook for myself. I have become more independant. I have a lavender plant at the place where I live because it keeps my place smell good. I start loving the color purple. The purple color is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition. Purple also represents meanings of wealth, creativity, wisdom, dignity, grandeur, devotion, peace, pride, mystery, independence, and magic.</p>
