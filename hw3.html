    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">What do you mean?</h2>
       
        <p>Imagine today is the last day of your life, what would you love to do before it ends? Is there some where you would love to visit? Certain food you would like to try? Or someone you really want to see?</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Lots of people are working very hard seven days a week, they try to make as much money as they can to buy a house in bay area.<br>Unfortunately this is very unhealthy for their life. They have higher chances to make their life shorter by over working, then whatever rich life becomes zero.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">What should you do?</h2>  
    
        <p>I am not asking you to stop working and go ahead live a life. What I am trying to say here is, you should give yourself a break once in a while. To feel what are the most valuable things in your life.</p>
