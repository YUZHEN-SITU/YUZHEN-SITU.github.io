    <h3>What do you mean?</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine today is the last day of your life, what would you love to do before it ends? Is there some where you would love to visit? Certain food you would like to try? Or someone you really want to see?
        </p>
    <p>
        Lots of people are working very hard seven days a week, they try to make as much money as they can to buy a house in bay area. Unfortunately this is very unhealthy for their life. They have higher chances to make their life shorter by over working, then whatever rich life becomes zero.</p>

    <h3>What should you do?</h3>  
    
    <p>I am not asking you to stop working and go ahead live a life. What I am trying to say here is, you should give yourself a break once in a while. To feel what are the most valuable things in your life.</p>

    <p>So what come through your mind right now? Still trying to think? Actually, would you like to start thinking about these?</p>
    
    <P>Run a marathon<br>
    Go horseback riding<br>
    Do an extreme sport<br>
    Visit your grandparents<br>
    Connect with past teachers<br>
    Give a heartfelt surprise to someone<br>
    Be a mentor to someone<br>
    Sing to an audience</P>
    
    <p>Believe or not, once you start thinking, you would find out you have already missed a lot of things in the past, and you will feel there are so much stuffs you can not wait to try in life!</p>
